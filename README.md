# LiDAR 3D Scanner for iOS (SwiftUI + ARKit)

A SwiftUI-based iOS app that leverages Apple's LiDAR sensors and ARKit to scan real-world environments, generate a detailed 3D mesh, and export it as a .OBJ file for 3D preview, analysis, or further processing.

## ‚ú® Features

-   Real-time environment scanning using LiDAR sensors (iPhone / iPad Pro).
    
-   Mesh generation with detailed depth mapping and surface reconstruction.
    
-   Export 3D mesh as a standard `.OBJ` file.
    
-   Preview scanned models with pan, zoom, and rotate controls in an ARKit scene.
    
-   Smooth SwiftUI interface integrated with ARKit rendering.
    

## üì± Requirements

-   iOS 16.0+
    
-   Xcode 15+
    
-   Device with LiDAR sensor (e.g., iPhone 12 Pro, 13 Pro, 14 Pro, or iPad Pro).
